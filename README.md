# wp-update-scanner

WordPress installations get bloated when a plugin is installed for each and every feature.
I started developing a set of scripts to work independently of the website and scan the website once a week. If any updates pop up I'll get notified about it.

### *\*\*\* This is a work in progress. The remaining tasks need to be completed before this project can be considered "finished":
- Finish bash portion
    - should alert if script fails
    - should alert if there are updates that need to be made
